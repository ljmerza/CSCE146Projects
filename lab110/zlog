 It is impossible to make things foolproof because fools are so ingenious
 buzz off banana nose and get thee hence
 I'm just a typical American boy from a typical American town
 When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
 To test or not to test that is the question Whether tis nobler for the tester's soul to suffer the barbs and snickers of outraged designers or to take arms against a sea of failures and by testing end them
 When I find myself in times of trouble
 The one who says it cannot be done must not interrupt the one who is doing it
